With our intuitive interface, you can easily create and edit existing yaml files that represent the domain of your application using the C4 model. It's important to note that while there is only one C4 model or domain, you can create multiple views of this model to better understand and communicate the relationships within your software system." ]

These views allow you to see the connections between actors, systems, containers, and their components, making it easy to understand the relationships within your software system. You can also layout the elements and edges of your view using our interface, allowing you to easily arrange and present your software architecture in a clear and visually appealing way. Our interface also enables you to zoom, scroll, and navigate through the selected view, allowing you to easily explore and understand your software architecture in greater detail." ]

This ensures that your software architecture is clear and consistent, making it easier to understand and communicate to others." ]

Our application supports the four main types of entities in the C4 model: actors, systems, containers, and components. Systems in the C4 model usually represent applications or services that bring value to the end users, while containers are units that can usually be deployed independently. Components, on the other hand, are buildable packages that are usually represented as artifacts in the file system." ]
