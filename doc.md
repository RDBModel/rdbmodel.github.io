# Model yaml description

- Ring represents system that communicates with other external or internal systems and brings value to the business.
- Delivery represents the minimal deployable unit of the system (ring). It means it can be deployed independently withing the other system deliveries if it doesn't break its contract.
- Block represents the minimal buildable artifact (e.g. library, set of scripts) which are deployed in the scope of the delivery. But it is an separate entity in the deployed application, like dll, file and so on.
